#####Project Log #1: 25-1-2015.  

Issues to raise:  
 1. Structure of the model, e.g. Gene Expression, Type of Irradiance, Is there a specific target?  
  1. Reference to paper, The spatial pattern of light determines the kinetics and modulates backpropagation of optogenetic action potentials.  
  2. Will the project be similiar to the structure of the paper? Expanded to neural networks? Which type of networks in particular? Biological or Artificial?  
 2. Add functionality to BRIAN or write simulation frameworks like the example files.  
 3. Discussion with BRIAN creator. After initial BRIAN code review, it is huge and difficult to find where to start to add in optogenetic functionality.  
 4. Expectations for interim report

Things to do:  
 1. Performance measurement matric  
  1. Produce expected results on known neural networks
 2. Contingency plan
